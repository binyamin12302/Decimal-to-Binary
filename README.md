# 🖥️ Decimal to Binary Converter with Call Stack Animation

A **recursive** decimal-to-binary converter that visually demonstrates how recursion works using **JavaScript Call Stack animation**.

🔹 Enter a decimal number, and see how the **recursive function** converts it to binary step by step.  
🔹 Watch the **Call Stack animation** to understand **how recursion works** in real-time.  
❗ **Note:** The **stack animation currently works only when the input is `5`**.

## 🎯 **How It Works**
1️⃣ The user enters a **decimal number** in the input field.  
2️⃣ The program **recursively** converts it to **binary** using JavaScript recursion.  
3️⃣ **Each function call is visualized** in the Call Stack animation (works only for `5`).  
4️⃣ Once the recursion completes, the final **binary number** is displayed.

## ⚡ **Technologies Used**
✅ **HTML5** – Page structure  
✅ **CSS3** – Styling & responsiveness  
✅ **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Recursion, DOM manipulation, Call Stack visualization  
✅ **Netlify** *(for live deployment)*

## 🚀 **How to Run Locally**
1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/binyamin12302/Decimal-to-Binary.git
2️⃣ Open the index.html file in your browser.

(Optional: If using Live Server in VS Code, just right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server")

📚 What I Learned
🔹 How recursion works in JavaScript
🔹 How to visualize the Call Stack with animations
🔹 Working with setTimeout to control animation flow
🔹 Handling user input and validation in JavaScript

🛠️ Future Improvements
📌 Support stack animation for any number, not just 5.
📌 Add a "Step-by-Step" mode to slow down the recursion process.
